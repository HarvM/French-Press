## General info
At the start of lockdown, going to Tesco felt like going over the trenches so I wanted to make something simple that my parents could use to help make things a little less stressful for them. I had noticed that they were continually heading out with a slip of paper/the back of an envelope/some ripped from something important and wanted to change that

## Features
* Easily add items using the text entry field
* Eadily remove any items with the stand left swipe or by using the 'Edit' function and then selecting the item to be removed

## Future Features
* Allow users across a defined group share their shopping lists
* Create a Favourites list to allow easy addition to the list for items that are frequently bought (MLModel or one the user can define their self)

## Status
Project is: _Under Development_

## Inspiration
The Bear application is a beauty and I can only aspire to make something as simple and functional as that. The world does need more list applications...
