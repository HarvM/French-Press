## General info
At the start of lockdown, going to the supermarket felt like staring down the barrel of a loaded gun, so I wanted to make something simple that my parents could use to help make things a little less stressful for them. I had noticed that they were continually heading out with a slip of paper/the back of an envelope/some ripped from something important or nothing at all and wanted to change that.

I've also returned from the shops more times than I care to remember missing an item or five
