## General info
At the start of lockdown, going to Tesco felt like going over the trenches so I wanted to make something simple that my parents could use to help make things a little less stressful for them. I had noticed that they were continually heading out with a slip of paper/the back of an envelope/some ripped from something important and wanted to change that. 

## Technologies
* ShoppingItems - version 1.0
* XCode version: 12.0 Beta

## Features

* MapKit integrationt to allow the user to find their nearest supermarket

## Inspiration
The Bear application is a beauty and I can only aspire to make something as simple and functional as that but the world does need more list applications...
