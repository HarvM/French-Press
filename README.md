## General info
At the start of lockdown, going to Tesco felt like going over the trenches so I wanted to make something simple that my parents could use to help make things a little less stressful for them. I had noticed that they were continually heading out with a slip of paper/the back of an envelope/some ripped from something important and wanted to change that.

## Features
* Easily add items using the text entry field
* The user can specify the quantity and add any extra notes too
* With the quantity: the user can say if it's a pack/bag/tin etc from a Picker
* A DetailView that will show both the item and any of the notes that the user has input
* All entries on the model are stored in CoreData
* Eadily remove any items with the stand left swipe or by using the 'Edit' function and then selecting the item to be removed

## Future Features
* Allow users across a defined group share their shopping lists (Family Sharing)
* Create a Favourites list to allow easy addition to the list for items that are frequently bought
* Let the users define items by categories like "Fruit and veg", "Household Products", etc
* Use of VNRecognizeTextRequest to allow the user to "scan in" any hand written shopping lists

## Inspiration
The Bear application is a beauty and I can only aspire to make something as simple and functional as that. The world does need more list applications...
